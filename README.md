# Movies ETL

## Background

The client, Amazing Prime Video (represented by Britta), is a streaming platform hosted by the world's largest online retailer, Amazing Prime.  To facilitate the purchase of streaming rights at the lowest possible cost, the client has sponsored a hackathon whose goal is the development of an algorithm that predicts the popularity of low-budget films.  The client provided two data sources (Wikipedia and ratings).  Initial analysis included extracting the data, transforming it into a dataset, and loading it into a SQL table for use by the local coding community.

## Purpose

Following the analysis above, the client requested Python code to keep the SQL table updated daily.  The required the development of an automated pipline to extract, transform, and load data from three files (Wikipedia, ratings, and Kaggle metadata).
